A Streamlit app that detects sarcasm using distilBERT

# 🤖 Sarcasm Detector

A stylish and sassy web app that detects sarcasm in sentences using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model — built with ❤️ using Streamlit, Transformers, and TensorFlow.

## 🧠 What It Does

This app takes any English sentence and predicts whether it's sarcastic or not, using the power of BERT (specifically `DistilBERT`). 

Whether you're decoding passive-aggressive tweets or just testing out your tone, this app has your back. 😏
